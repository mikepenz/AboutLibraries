### Upgrade Notes

#### v13.0.0

- **Breaking Change**: Deprecated APIs from v12.x.y were removed
- **Breaking Change**: The `Gradle Plugin` was split into 2. The main plugin that is registering all the manual tasks, and an Android specific one automatically registering the Android auto
  generation task.
  - For most projects the manual tasks are recommended. Only if you require or want to use the generation as part of the android build, use the `.android` plugin.

```kotlin
// To use the Android auto registering plugin - add the following to your module:
id("com.mikepenz.aboutlibraries.plugin.android")
```
- **Breaking Change**: Reworked the `LibraryColors` interface to be more descriptive and more flexible
  - Renamed `backgroundColor` to `libraryBackgroundColor`
  - Renamed `contentColor` to `libraryContentColor`
  - Added new background, content color variants for the dialog

#### v12.2.0

- **Breaking Change**: Renamed `nameTextStyles` in `libraryTextStyles`/`LibraryTextStyles` to `nameTextStyle` (to align with other styles).
- **Breaking Change**: Introduced new `libraryPadding()` default function to replace the existing one. This moves to use a new class to hold chip paddings.
- **Breaking Change**: Wrappers around the `LibrariesContainer` were deprecated in favor of `remember*` functions. To be removed in release `13.x.y`.
- **Breaking Change**: The `LicenseDialogBody` now also accepts the `Modifier` to include padding in text instead of scrollable container
- **Deprecate**: Deprecate series of APIs to cleanup and simplify API surface, and simplify maintenance.
- **Note**: Updated README to suggest new non deprecated API for using `LibrariesContainer` on Android.

#### v12.0.0

- **Dependency Upgrade**: Kotlin 2.1.20
- **Breaking Change**: The `Gradle Plugin` and `Compose UI` library have undergone significant changes, including multiple breaking API changes.
- **Breaking Change**: The `Gradle Plugin` has moved to a `Property` based configuration schema with nested configs for better organization.
- **Breaking Change**: The `Gradle Plugin's` configuration options which were `Array` or `List` types have been changed to `Set` types.
- **Breaking Change**: The `Gradle Plugin` now only has a singular `outputPath` property, to specify where the generated file should be written to.
- **Behaviour Change**: The `Gradle Plugin` will now do parts of the setup during configuration time to improve configuration cache compatibility.
- **Breaking Change**: The Compose UI APIs were overhauled to improve the API and reduce the number of parameters, and make it more flexible for the future.

API changes to simplify the expansion and configuration of the compose UI.

v11.x.y

```kotlin
LibrariesContainer(
    itemContentPadding = PaddingValues(16.dp),
    itemSpacing = 2.dp
)
```

v12.x.y

```kotlin
LibrariesContainer(
    padding = LibraryDefaults.libraryPadding(contentPadding = PaddingValues(16.dp)),
    dimensions = LibraryDefaults.libraryDimensions(itemSpacing = 2.dp),
)
```

#### v10.x.y

* v10 includes a major rewrite of the `Gradle Plugin`. The old `xml` string resource format
  definitions are no longer supported.

  the [migration guide](https://github.com/mikepenz/Android-Iconics/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md)

#### v6.2.x

* Upgraded the library to use `androidX` dependencies. This means your project will need to depend
  on `androidX` dependencies too. If you still use appcompat please consider using a version older
  than v6.2.x.
