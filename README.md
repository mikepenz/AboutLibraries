<details><summary><b>Gradle Plugin Configuration Options</b></summary>
<p>

## Gradle Plugin Configuration

The plugin allows customization via the `aboutLibraries` extension in your build script.

```kts
aboutLibraries {
    // Allow to enable "offline mode", will disable any network check of the plugin (including [fetchRemoteLicense] or pulling spdx license texts)
    offlineMode = false

    android {
        // - If the automatic registered android tasks are disabled, a similar thing can be achieved manually
        // - `./gradlew app:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.outputFile=src/main/res/raw/aboutlibraries.json`
        // - the resulting file can for example be added as part of the SCM
        // - the `outputFile` can also be changed by setting `outputFile` via the DSL.
        registerAndroidTasks = false
    }

    collect {
        // Define the path configuration files are located in. E.g. additional libraries, licenses to add to the target .json
        // Warning: Please do not use the parent folder of a module as path, as this can result in issues. More details: https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries/issues/936
        // The path provided is relative to the modules path (not project root)
        configPath = file("../config")

        // (optional) GitHub token to raise API request limit to allow fetching more licenses
        gitHubApiToken = if (hasProperty("github.pat")) property("github.pat")?.toString() else null

        // Enable fetching of "remote" licenses.  Uses the API of supported source hosts
        // See https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries#special-repository-support
        // A `gitHubApiToken` is required for this to work as it fetches information from GitHub's API.

        // See https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries#special-repository-support
        // A `gitHubApiToken` is required for this to work as it fetches information from GitHub's API.
        fetchRemoteFunding = false

        // Allows to only collect dependencies of specific variants during the `collectDependencies` step.
        // filterVariants.addAll("debug", "release")

        includePlatform = true
    }

    export {
        // Define the output path (including fileName). Modifying this will disable the automatic meta data discovery for supported platforms.
        outputFile = file("src/commonMain/composeResources/files/aboutlibraries.json")

        // variant = "release"

        // Allows to exclude some fields from the generated meta data field.

<details><summary><b>Modify Libraries / Licenses</b></summary>
<p>

## Modify libraries / licenses

The plugin offers the ability to add or override library and license details by placing JSON files
in the `libraries` and `licenses` directories within the configured `configPath`.
See the [config directory](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries/blob/develop/config/) for examples.

## Provide funding information

The plugin offers the ability to add or override funding details by placing a `funding.json` JSON file in the `funding` directory within the configured `configPath`.
Alternatively the `exportFunding` task can be used to generate this data automatically (ensure to provide a GitHub API Key).
The task will automatically write the file in the respective folder. Note: It will overwrite the file if it already exists.

```bash
./gradlew app:exportFunding
```

### Libraries

Provide additional or modify existing libraries via a `.json` file per library.
If the `uniqueId` overlaps, a merge will occur.

```json
{
  "uniqueId": "com.mikepenz:materialdrawer",
  "developers": [
    {
      "name": "Mike Penz",
      "organisationUrl": "https://mikepenz.dev"
    }
  ],
  "description": "(Merged) The flexible, easy to use, all in one drawer library for your Android project.",
  "name": "ABC MaterialDrawer Library",
  "website": "https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer"
}
```

### Licenses

Provide additional or modify existing licenses via a `.json` file per license.

If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.\n<br />\n6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.\n<br />\n7. Third Party Applications\n<br />\n7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.\n<br />\n7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.\n<br />\n7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.\n<br />\n8. Using Android APIs\n<br />\n8.1 Google Data APIs\n<br />\n8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).

Changes to the License Agreement\n<br />\n13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.\n<br />\n14. General Legal Terms\n<br />\n14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.\n<br />\n14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.\n<br />\n14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.\n<br />\n14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.\n<br />\n14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.\n<br />\n14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.\n<br />\n14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.",

## Dependencies

> The AboutLibraries libraries are published to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.mikepenz/aboutlibraries-core).
> Using a version catalog (`libs.versions.toml`) is the recommended way to manage dependencies.

### `libs.versions.toml` (Recommended)

```toml
[versions]
aboutLibraries = "{latest-version}"

[libraries]
# Core module (required for accessing library data)
aboutlibraries-core = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-core", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }
# Compose UI modules (choose one or both)
aboutlibraries-compose-core = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose-core", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" } # Common compose core
aboutlibraries-compose-m2 = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }      # Material 2 UI
aboutlibraries-compose-m3 = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose-m3", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }      # Material 3 UI
# Deprecated View-based UI module
aboutlibraries-view = { module = "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }

[plugins]
aboutLibraries = { id = "com.mikepenz.aboutlibraries.plugin", version.ref = "aboutLibraries" }
```

## Core-module

Include the core module to access the generated library information programmatically.

```gradle
// build.gradle.kts
// Recommended: Using version catalog
implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.core)

// Alternative: Direct dependency declaration
// implementation("com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-core:${latestAboutLibsRelease}")
```

<details><summary><b>(Advanced) Usage</b></summary>
<p>

## Access generated library details

To create a individual integration, access the generated library information programmatically
through the core module.

```kotlin
val libs = Libs.Builder()
    .withJson(aboutLibsJson) // provide the metaData (alternative APIs available)
    .build()
val libraries = libs.libraries // retrieve all libraries defined in the metadata
val licenses = libs.licenses // retrieve all licenses defined in the metadata
for (lib in libraries) {
    Log.i("AboutLibraries", "${lib.name}")
}
```

</p>
</details>

## UI-module (Compose)

Include the Compose UI module(s) for easy integration into Jetpack Compose applications.

```gradle
// build.gradle.kts
// Recommended: Using version catalog (choose M2 or M3, or both)
implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.compose.m2) // Material 2
implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.compose.m3) // Material 3

// Alternative: Direct dependency declaration
// implementation("com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose:${latestAboutLibsRelease}") // Material 2
// implementation("com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose-m3:${latestAboutLibsRelease}") // Material 3
```

### Usage

```kotlin
// Android: Provide resource identifier for the `R.raw.aboutlibraries` file.
val libraries by rememberLibraries(R.raw.aboutlibraries)
LibrariesContainer(libraries, Modifier.fillMaxSize())

// Multiplatform: Using compose-resources API (e.g., src/commonMain/composeResources/files/aboutlibraries.json)
val libraries by rememberLibraries {
    Res.readBytes("files/aboutlibraries.json").decodeToString()
}
LibrariesContainer(libraries, Modifier.fillMaxSize())


// Multiplatform: Manually loading JSON
val libraries by rememberLibraries {
    // Replace with your specific resource loading logic
    useResource("aboutlibraries.json") { res -> res.bufferedReader().readText() }
}
LibrariesContainer(libraries, Modifier.fillMaxSize())
```

<details><summary><b>Advanced Usage</b></summary>
<p>

### Advanced Usage

Provide custom header, divider, and footer items for the `LibrariesContainer`.

```kotlin
// custom header, divider, footer
LibrariesContainer(
    libraries = libraries,
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize().padding(it),
    header = {
        item {
            Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().padding(16.dp), contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) {
                Text("Hello Header")
            }
        }
    },
    divider = { HorizontalDivider() },
    footer = {
        item {
            Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().padding(16.dp), contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) {
                Text("Hello Footer")
            }
        }
    }
)
```

<details><summary><b>Compose Multiplatform (Desktop, Wasm, etc.)</b></summary>
<p>

The core and compose modules are Kotlin Multiplatform compatible.
The `app-desktop` and `app-wasm` modules demonstrate usage outside of Android, including manual generation and inclusion of the dependency metadata.

### Generate Dependency Information

Manually export the definitions using the Gradle task. This is typically needed for non-Android platforms or when `registerAndroidTasks` is disabled.

```bash
# Export definitions to the specified file (e.g., for desktop)
./gradlew :app-desktop:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.outputFile=src/main/resources/libraries.json

# Filter exported definition by variant (e.g., for wasmJs target)
./gradlew :app-wasm:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.outputFile=src/jsMain/resources/aboutlibraries.json -PaboutLibraries.exportVariant=wasmJs
```

### Run Demo app(s)

```bash
# JVM Desktop app
./gradlew :app-desktop:run

# WASM Web app
./gradlew :app-wasm:run
```

## (Legacy) UI-module (View-based)

> [!WARNING]
> **Deprecated:** The legacy View-based UI module (`com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries`) is deprecated and will receive limited support.
> Please migrate to the [Compose UI module](#ui-module-compose).
> For embedding Compose in Views, consider using [ComposeView](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/interoperability-apis/compose-in-views).
> While newer Gradle plugin versions *might* be compatible with older UI modules regarding the data format, migration is strongly recommended.

```gradle
// build.gradle.kts
// Recommended: Using version catalog
implementation(libs.aboutlibraries.view)

// Alternative: Direct dependency declaration
// implementation("com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries:${latestAboutLibsRelease}")
```

<details><summary><b>Legacy Usage</b></summary>
<p>

### Usage

Use this library in a few different ways. Create a custom activity, including a custom style or just
use its generated information. Or simply use the built-in Activity or Fragment and just pass the
libs to include.

> **Note**: The new version requires the new Material3 theme as base.

#### Activity

```kotlin
LibsBuilder()
    .start(this) // start the activity
```

The activity uses a toolbar, which requires the appropriate theme.
See [Style the AboutLibraries](#style-the-aboutlibraries-%EF%B8%8F) for more details

#### Fragment

```kotlin
val fragment = LibsBuilder()
    .supportFragment()
```

#### About this App UI

The `AboutLibraries` library also offers the ability to create an `About this app` screen.
Add the following .xml file (or just the strings - the key must be the same) to the project.

```xml

<resources>
    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_showIcon">true</string>
    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_showVersion">true</string>
    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_text">Place the description here :D</string>
</resources>
```

or use the builder and add following:

```kotlin
.withAboutIconShown(true)
    .withAboutVersionShown(true)
    .withAboutDescription("This is a small sample which can be set in the about my app description file.<br /><b>Style this with html markup :D</b>")
```

#### Style the AboutLibraries üñåÔ∏è

Create a custom style for the AboutLibraries UI.

```xml
// define a custom style
<style name="CustomAboutLibrariesStyle" parent="">
    <!-- AboutLibraries specific values -->
    <item name="aboutLibrariesCardBackground">?cardBackgroundColor</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesDescriptionTitle">?android:textColorPrimary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesDescriptionText">?android:textColorSecondary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesDescriptionDivider">@color/opensource_divider</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesOpenSourceTitle">?android:textColorPrimary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesOpenSourceText">?android:textColorSecondary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesSpecialButtonText">?android:textColorPrimary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesOpenSourceDivider">@color/opensource_divider</item>
</style>

        // define the custom styles for the theme

<style name="SampleApp" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar">
...
<item name="aboutLibrariesStyle">@style/CustomAboutLibrariesStyle</item>
...
</style>
```

</p>
</details>

## Enterprise / Manual JSON Handling

For environments requiring full control over the included `aboutlibraries.json` (e.g., manual verification, CI generation), you can disable automatic task registration and handle
generation manually.

```kts
// build.gradle.kts
aboutLibraries {
    android {
        // Disable automatic task registration for Android builds
        registerAndroidTasks = false
    }
    export {
        // Define the output path for manual generation
        // Adjust the path based on your project structure (e.g., composeResources, Android res/raw)
        outputFile = file("src/commonMain/composeResources/files/aboutlibraries.json")
        // Optionally specify the variant for export
        // variant = "release"
    }
}
```

Generate the file manually using the Gradle task:

```bash
# Generate using the configured location and variant
./gradlew :app:exportLibraryDefinitions

# Generate providing a custom path and variant override
./gradlew :app:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.outputFile=src/main/res/raw/libraries.json -PaboutLibraries.exportVariant=release
```

Commit the generated `aboutlibraries.json` to your SCM. The library will then need to load this file manually. See details in [Usage](#usage).

## Gradle API / Tasks

By default, the gradle plugin is automatically executed for Android projects, generating the library
metadata where it's automatically discovered by the `ui` modules.
For other environments or for more advanced usages the plugin offers additional APIs.

```bash
# Manually generate the dependency metaData in the provided location. Allows to commit it in SCM
# Exports the metaData in `src/main/resources/` relative to the module root
./gradlew app-desktop:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.outputFile=src/main/resources/libraries.json
# Export only for a specific variant: `release`
./gradlew app-desktop:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.outputFile=src/main/resources/libraries.json -PaboutLibraries.exportVariant=release

# Export dependencies to CLI in CSV format
./gradlew app:exportLibraries
./gradlew app:exportLibraries${Variant}

# Outputs all dependencies with name, version and their identifier
./gradlew app:findLibraries

# Exports all dependencies in a format helpful for compliance reports.
# By default writes `export.csv` and `export.txt` and `dependencies` folder in the root of the project.
./gradlew app:exportComplianceLibraries${Variant} -PaboutLibraries.exportPath=complianceReport/

# List all funding options for included projects (as identified via the e.g.: GitHub API)
./gradlew app:fundLibraries
```

# Disclaimer

This library uses all compile time dependencies (and their sub dependencies) as defined in the
`build.gradle` file.
This could lead to dependencies which are only used during compilation (and not actually distributed
in the app) to be listed or missing in the attribution screen.
It might also fail to identify licenses if the dependencies do not define it properly in their
pom.xml file.

Careful optimisation and review of all licenses is recommended to really include all required
dependencies. The use of the gradle commands like `findLibraries` can help doing this.

It is also important that native sub dependencies can *not* be resolved automatically as they are
not included via gradle.
Additional dependencies can be provided via the plugins API to extend and provide any additional
details.

# Credits

Starting from v12.1.0 some parts of the plugin were refactored to use different APIs to retrieve dependencies.
Some of these refactored components were heavily inspired by the amazing https://github.com/cashapp/licensee/tree/1.13.0 project.
