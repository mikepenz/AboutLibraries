The **AboutLibraries** library allows you to easily create an **used open source libraries** fragment/activity within your app. As an extra feature you can also add an **about this app** section. 

Here's a quick overview of functions it include:
- **used open source libraries**
	- name, description, creator, license, version, ...
- **about this app** section (optional)
- autodetect libraries
- many included library details
- automatic created fragment/activity
- feature rich builder to simply create and start the fragment / activity
- much much more... try the sample for a quick overview.

#Motivation

Most modern apps feature an "Used Library"-section and for this some information of those libs is required. As it gets annoying to copy those strings always to your app I've developed this small helper library to provide the required information.

##Include in your project
###Using Maven
The AboutLibraries Library is pushed to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22com.mikepenz%22), so you just need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`. It seems it is also required to add the support dependencies to the application. If it works without, you should be fine too :).

```javascript
compile('com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries:5.7.1@aar') {
	transitive = true
}
```

Further information and how to use it if you can't update to the newest v21 support libs can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries/wiki/HOWTO:-Include)

##Usage
You can use this library in a few different ways. You can create your own activity, including a custom style and just use the information, or you can use the built-in Activity or Fragment and just pass the libs you would love to include.

###Upgrade Notes
#### < v5.0.0
Changed maven group. You can get all updates via the new one `com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries:5.y.z@aar`
The `Libs.Builder` is no more. It was changed to `LibsBuilder`. Just remove the "." and it is working again.

###Activity / Fragment
####Fragment
```java
LibsFragment fragment = new LibsBuilder()
        //get the fragment
        .fragment();
```
####Activity
#####Code:
```java
new LibsBuilder()
        //provide a style (optional) (LIGHT, DARK, LIGHT_DARK_TOOLBAR)
        .withActivityStyle(Libs.ActivityStyle.LIGHT_DARK_TOOLBAR)
        //start the activity
        .start(this);
```

##Small extra
For those who read the whole README here's one more thing.
You can also use the AboutLibraries activity as an "about this app" screen. You ask how?
Yeah pretty simple just add the following .xml file (or just the strings - the key must be the same) to your project.

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_showIcon">true</string>
    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_showVersion">true</string>
    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_text">Place your description here :D</string>
</resources>
```
or use the builder and add following:
```java
	.withAboutIconShown(true)
	.withAboutVersionShown(true)
	.withAboutDescription("This is a small sample which can be set in the about my app description file.<br /><b>You can style this with html markup :D</b>")

```

##ProGuard
Exclude `R` from ProGuard to enable the library auto detection
```proguard
-keep class .R
-keep class **.R$* {
    <fields>;
}
```

##Contribute
You can contribute by creating a information file for a new library, and open a pull-request at the creators Git repository. If he doesn't include the information file in his repo, or if the library isn't maintained anymore you can create a pull-request here. Find more information in the wiki [Create a definition file](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries/wiki/HOWTODEV:-Include-into-AboutLibraries)
