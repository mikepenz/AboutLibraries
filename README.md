<p>

## Gradle Plugin Configuration

It is possible to provide custom configurations / adjustments to the automatic detection. This can be done via the gradle plugin.

```groovy
aboutLibraries {
    // - If the automatic registered android tasks are disabled, a similar thing can be achieved manually
    // - `./gradlew app:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.exportPath=src/main/res/raw`
    // - the resulting file can for example be added as part of the SCM
    registerAndroidTasks = false
    // Define the output file name. Modifying this will disable the automatic meta data discovery for supported platforms.
    outputFileName = "aboutlibraries.json"
    // Define the path configuration files are located in. E.g. additional libraries, licenses to add to the target .json
    // Warning: Please do not use the parent folder of a module as path, as this can result in issues. More details: https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries/issues/936
    configPath = "config"
    // Allow to enable "offline mode", will disable any network check of the plugin (including [fetchRemoteLicense] or pulling spdx license texts)
    offlineMode = false
    // Enable fetching of "remote" licenses.  Uses the API of supported source hosts
    // See https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries#special-repository-support
    fetchRemoteLicense = true
    // Enables fetching of "remote" funding information. Uses the API of supported source hosts
    // See https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries#special-repository-support
    fetchRemoteFunding = true
    // (Optional) GitHub token to raise API request limit to allow fetching more licenses
    gitHubApiToken = getLocalOrGlobalProperty("github.pat")
    // Full license text for license IDs mentioned here will be included, even if no detected dependency uses them.
    additionalLicenses = ["mit", "mpl_2_0"]
    // Allows to exclude some fields from the generated meta data field.
    // If the class name is specified, the field is only excluded for that class; without a class name, the exclusion is global.
    excludeFields = ["License.name", "developers", "funding"]
    // Enable inclusion of `platform` dependencies in the library report
    includePlatform = true
    // Define the strict mode, will fail if the project uses licenses not allowed
    // - This will only automatically fail for Android projects which have `registerAndroidTasks` enabled
    // For non Android projects, execute `exportLibraryDefinitions`
    strictMode = com.mikepenz.aboutlibraries.plugin.StrictMode.FAIL
    // Allowed set of licenses, this project will be able to use without build failure
    allowedLicenses = ["Apache-2.0", "asdkl"]
    // Enable the duplication mode, allows to merge, or link dependencies which relate
    duplicationMode = com.mikepenz.aboutlibraries.plugin.DuplicateMode.LINK
    // Configure the duplication rule, to match "duplicates" with
    duplicationRule = com.mikepenz.aboutlibraries.plugin.DuplicateRule.SIMPLE
    // Enable pretty printing for the generated JSON file
    prettyPrint = false
    // Allows to only collect dependencies of specific variants during the `collectDependencies` step.
    filterVariants = ["debug", "release"]
}
```

## Modify libraries / licenses

The plugin offers the ability to add additional libraries or licenses by specifying these under the `libraries` and respectively `licenses` directory, within the defined `configPath`.
This can be seen here: https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries/blob/develop/config/

### Libraries

Provide additional or modify existing libraries via a `.json` file per library.
If the `uniqueId` overlaps, a merge will occur.

```json
{
  "uniqueId": "com.mikepenz:materialdrawer",
  "developers": [
    {
      "name": "Mike Penz",
      "organisationUrl": "https://mikepenz.dev"
    }
  ],
  "description": "(Merged) The flexible, easy to use, all in one drawer library for your Android project.",
  "name": "ABC MaterialDrawer Library",
  "website": "https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer"
}
```

### Licenses

Provide additional or modify existing licenses via a `.json` file per license.

```json
{

Before any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.\n<br />\n6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.\n<br />\n7. Third Party Applications\n<br />\n7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.\n<br />\n7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.\n<br />\n7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.\n<br />\n8. Using Android APIs\n<br />\n8.1 Google Data APIs\n<br />\n8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.\n<br />\n8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.\n<br />\n9. Terminating this License Agreement\n<br />\n9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as set out below.\n<br />\n9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.\n<br />\n9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:<br />\n(A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or<br />\n(B) Google is required to do so by law; or<br />\n(C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or<br />\n(D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially viable.<br />\n<br />\n9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.\n<br />\n10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES\n<br />\n10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE.\n<br />\n10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.\n<br />\n10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n<br />\n11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n<br />\n11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.\n<br />\n12. Indemnification\n<br />\n12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.\n<br />\n13. Changes to the License Agreement\n<br />\n13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available on the website where the SDK is made available.\n<br />\n14. General Legal Terms\n<br />\n14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.\n<br />\n14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.\n<br />\n14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.\n<br />\n14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.\n<br />\n14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.\n<br />\n14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.\n<br />\n14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.",

## Core-module

> The AboutLibraries Library is pushed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.mikepenz/aboutlibraries-core).

```gradle
implementation "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-core:${latestAboutLibsRelease}"
```

<details><summary><b>(Advanced) Usage</b></summary>
<p>

## Access generated library details

To create a individual integration, access the generated library information programmatically through the core module.

```kotlin
val libs = Libs.Builder()
    .withJson(aboutLibsJson) // provide the metaData (alternative APIs available)
    .build()
val libraries = libs.libraries // retrieve all libraries defined in the metadata
val licenses = libs.licenses // retrieve all licenses defined in the metadata
for (lib in libraries) {
    Log.i("AboutLibraries", "${lib.name}")
}
```

</p>
</details>

## UI-module

```gradle
implementation "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose:${latestAboutLibsRelease}"

// Alternative Material3 based module
implementation "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries-compose-m3:${latestAboutLibsRelease}"
```

### Usage

```kotlin
// android (when using the default resource location
LibrariesContainer(
    Modifier.fillMaxSize()
)

// compose resource API
val libraries by rememberLibraries {
  Res.readBytes("files/aboutlibraries.json").decodeToString()
}

// compose manually
  val libraries by rememberLibraries {
  useResource("aboutlibraries.json") { res -> res.bufferedReader().readText() }
}

LibrariesContainer(libraries, Modifier.fillMaxSize())
```

<details><summary><b>Compose-jb</b></summary>
<p>

The core module and the compose module are Kotlin-Multiplatform projects.
Find a sample application as the `app-desktop` module. It showcases the usage to manually generate the dependency meta information and include as part of the SCM.

### Generate Dependency Information

```bash
./gradlew :app-desktop:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.exportPath=src/main/resources/

# Filter exported definition by variant by passing `-PaboutLibraries.exportVariant==<VARIANT>`
./gradlew :app-wasm:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.exportPath=src/main/resources/ -PaboutLibraries.exportVariant=wasmJs
./gradlew :app-wasm:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.exportPath=src/main/resources/ -PaboutLibraries.exportVariant=jvm
```

### Run Demo app(s)

```
# JVM Desktop app
./gradlew :app-desktop:run

# WASM Web app
./gradlew :app-wasm:run
```

### Screenshot

</p>
</details>

## (Legacy) UI-module

```gradle
implementation "com.mikepenz:aboutlibraries:${latestAboutLibsRelease}"
```

<details><summary><b>Usage</b></summary>
<p>

### Usage

Use this library in a few different ways. Create a custom activity, including a custom style or just use its generated information. Or simply use the built-in Activity or Fragment and just pass the libs to include.

> **Note**: The new version requires the new Material3 theme as base.

#### Activity

```kotlin
LibsBuilder()
    .start(this) // start the activity
```

The activity uses a toolbar, which requires the appropriate theme. See [Style the AboutLibraries](#style-the-aboutlibraries-%EF%B8%8F) for more details

#### Fragment
```kotlin
val fragment = LibsBuilder()
    .supportFragment()
```

#### About this App UI
The `AboutLibraries` library also offers the ability to create an `About this app` screen.
Add the following .xml file (or just the strings - the key must be the same) to the project.

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_showIcon">true</string>
    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_showVersion">true</string>
    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_text">Place the description here :D</string>
</resources>
```
or use the builder and add following:
```kotlin
.withAboutIconShown(true)
.withAboutVersionShown(true)
.withAboutDescription("This is a small sample which can be set in the about my app description file.<br /><b>Style this with html markup :D</b>")
```

#### Style the AboutLibraries üñåÔ∏è

Create a custom style for the AboutLibraries UI.

```xml
// define a custom style
<style name="CustomAboutLibrariesStyle" parent="">
    <!-- AboutLibraries specific values -->
    <item name="aboutLibrariesCardBackground">?cardBackgroundColor</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesDescriptionTitle">?android:textColorPrimary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesDescriptionText">?android:textColorSecondary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesDescriptionDivider">@color/opensource_divider</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesOpenSourceTitle">?android:textColorPrimary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesOpenSourceText">?android:textColorSecondary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesSpecialButtonText">?android:textColorPrimary</item>
    <item name="aboutLibrariesOpenSourceDivider">@color/opensource_divider</item>
</style>

// define the custom styles for the theme
<style name="SampleApp" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar">
    ...
    <item name="aboutLibrariesStyle">@style/CustomAboutLibrariesStyle</item>
    ...
</style>
```

</p>
</details>


## Enterprise

Since v10 of the AboutLibraries plugin it is possible to disable the automatic registration of the plugin task as part of the build system.
```
aboutLibraries {
    registerAndroidTasks = false
}
```

This is especially beneficial for enterprise environments where it is required to be in full control of the included `aboutlibraries.json`.
After disabling the integration it is possible to manually update the definitions, or do it on your CI environment.
```
./gradlew app:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.exportPath=src/main/res/raw/ -PaboutLibraries.exportVariant=release
```
This generated file can be either included in your SCM, and every build will use this exact verified and approved state.
Additionally, this helps to ensure no issues occur during the apps delivery phase, as the respective file is already generated and included.

The library offers complete customisation for this behavior and location or name for the generated files can be adjusted as needed.
A full compose code example providing the `Libs` manually:

```kotlin
LibrariesContainer(
    librariesBlock = { ctx ->
        Libs.Builder().withJson(ctx, R.raw.aboutlibraries).build()
    }
)
```

## Gradle API

By default, the gradle plugin is automatically executed for Android projects, generating the library metadata where it's automatically discovered by the `ui` modules.
For other environments or for more advanced usages the plugin offers additional APIs.

```bash
# Manually generate the dependency metaData in the provided location. Allows to commit it in SCM
# Exports the metaData in `src/main/resources/` relative to the module root
./gradlew app-desktop:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.exportPath=src/main/resources/
# Export only for a specific variant: `release`
./gradlew app-desktop:exportLibraryDefinitions -PaboutLibraries.exportPath=src/main/resources/ -PaboutLibraries.exportVariant=release

# Export dependencies to CLI in CSV format
./gradlew exportLibraries
./gradlew exportLibraries${Variant}

# Outputs all dependencies with name, version and their identifier
./gradlew findLibraries

# Exports all dependencies in a format helpful for compliance reports.
# By default writes `export.csv` and `export.txt` and `dependencies` folder in the root of the project.
./gradlew exportComplianceLibraries${Variant}

# List all funding options for included projects (as identified via the e.g.: GitHub API)
./gradlew fundLibraries
```

# Disclaimer

This library uses all compile time dependencies (and their sub dependencies) as defined in the `build.gradle` file.
This could lead to dependencies which are only used during compilation (and not actually distributed in the app) to be listed or missing in the attribution screen.
It might also fail to identify licenses if the dependencies do not define it properly in their pom.xml file.

Careful optimisation and review of all licenses is recommended to really include all required dependencies. The use of the gradle commands like `findLibraries` can help doing this.

It is also important that native sub dependencies can *not* be resolved automatically as they are not included via gradle.
Additional dependencies can be provided via the plugins API to extend and provide any additional details.
