all of its right, title and interest in and to any Developer Feedback to Crashlytics and
acknowledges that Crashlytics has the unrestricted right to use and exploit such Developer
Feedback in any manner, without attribution, and without any obligations or compensation to
Developer.</br></br>
2.5 Developer Data. Developer hereby grants Crashlytics a nonexclusive, license fee free and
royalty free right and license to access, copy, distribute, process and use all information, data
and other content provided by Developer or received by Crashlytics in connection with
Developer’s authorized use of the Services, including, without limitation information provided
through any Application or Beta Application that Developer makes available for testing through
the Services (collectively, “Developer Data”), solely for the purpose of providing, developing,
and maintaining the Services, along with any related customer or technical support, and as
otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement. Developer agrees that: (a) the Services
depend on the availability of the Developer Data, and (b) Crashlytics will not assume any
responsibility or liability for, or undertake to verify, the legality, accuracy or completeness of the
Developer Data. Crashlytics shall have no obligation to store any Developer Data or Results (as
defined below).</br></br>
2.6 Access by Beta Testers; EULA; End Users; Compliance. Developer shall provide to
Crashlytics the contact information of any user of Developer’s application(s) whom Developer
intends to invite to become a Beta Tester. Developer is solely responsible for determining which
users will receive an invitation to become a Beta Tester, and for ensuring the accuracy of any
user contact information provided to Crashlytics. Developer may provide Beta Testers with its
own EULA for a Beta Application that will be accessed by Beta Testers (“Developer EULA”);
provided that the Developer EULA provides terms and conditions consistent with this Agreement
and, with respect to Crashlytics, no less protective than those terms and conditions set forth in
the standard EULA provided in Appendix A (“Standard EULA”). If Developer does not provide a
separate Developer EULA to Beta Testers in connection with Developer’s Beta Application,
then Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Beta Testers, by accessing the Beta
Application through the Services, will be made subject to the terms and conditions of the
Standard EULA between Developer and such Beta Testers.. Developer acknowledges and
agrees that Crashlytics provides the Standard EULA by way of convenience only, and does not
represent or warrant that the Standard EULA will be enforceable under, or in compliance with,
all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or otherwise. Developer acknowledges and agrees that
the EULA applicable to Developer’s Beta Application shall be between Developer and any Beta
Tester, and Crashlytics shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever
for, such EULA, any application tested by a Beta Tester, or for any breach by Developer or any
Beta Tester of the terms and conditions of such EULA. The Services allow the Developer to
collect information relating to performance of Developer’s applications, including, without
limitation, device state information, unique device identifiers, information relating to the physical
location of a device, and information about how the application was used. Developer may turn
on features of the Services to allow collection of other information via the Services, including
some personally identifiable information (e.g., a user’s email address), which allows Developers
to communicate with users about the engagement with and functionality of their applications and
to invite them to become Beta Testers. Developer represents and warrants that Developer is
collecting information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user engagement
with and functionality of Developer’s applications, and to communicate with users about such
engagement and functionality. Developer agrees that it will not enable collection of personally
identifiable information via the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about
the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user has
provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and
without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card
information, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, dates of birth or physical
addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not invite any user to be a Beta
Tester that is under the age of consent as defined under any applicable laws, rules, or
regulations relating to data collection, including without limitation the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”), and all other relevant laws and
regulations. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Developer shall maintain a privacy
policy: (a) that is readily accessible to users from its website or within its online service (as
applicable), (b) that fully and accurately discloses to its users what information is collected about
its users, and (c) that states that such information is disclosed to and processed by third party
providers like Crashlytics in the manner contemplated by the Services, including, without
limitation, disclosure of the use of technology to track users’ activity and otherwise collect
information from users. For Developer’s users in the European Union, Developer shall provide
such users with clear notice of, and obtain such users’ consent to, the transfer, storage, and use
of their information in the United States and any other country where Crashlytics, or any third
party service providers acting on its behalf, operates, and shall further notify such users that the
privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the
country where such users live. Developer shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules
and regulations relating to data collection, privacy and security, including without limitation,
COPPA, GDPR, and all other such laws and regulations.. Developer will obtain and maintain
any required consents necessary and will comply with any other applicable requirements to
permit the processing of Developer Data under this Agreement.</br></br>
2.7 Developer Systems. Developer is responsible for providing: (a) all equipment, subscriptions
and credentials necessary for Crashlytics to receive the Developer Data, and (b) all modems,
servers, devices, storage, software (other than Software), databases, network and
communications equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise
use the Services at its facility (collectively, “Developer Systems”). Developer shall ensure that
Developer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all configurations and
specifications described in the Documentation.</br></br>
2.8 Limitations. Crashlytics will not be responsible or liable for any failures in the Services or any
other problems which are related to: (a) the Developer Data or Developer Systems, or (b) any
satellite, telecommunications, network or other equipment or service outside of Crashlytics’s
facilities or control.</br></br>
2.9 Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by one party
(“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) that is marked or otherwise identified as
“confidential” or “proprietary,” or by its nature or the circumstances of disclosure should
reasonably be understood to be confidential, including without limitation, all financial, business
or technical information disclosed in relation to this Agreement. Except for the specific rights
granted by this Agreement, the Recipient may not use, copy or disclose any Confidential
Information of the Discloser without Discloser’s prior written consent, and shall use no less than
reasonable care to safeguard Discloser’s Confidential Information, including ensuring that
Recipient’s employees, contractors and agents (“Representatives”)with access to Discloser’s
Confidential Information have a need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of
this Agreement and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective of the parties as
those set forth herein. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to any Confidential Information
that Recipient can demonstrate is: (a) already known by it without restriction, (b) rightfully
furnished to it without restriction by a third party not in breach of any obligation to Discloser, (c)
generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement or (d) independently
developed by it without reference to or use of any of Discloser’s Confidential Information and
without any violation of any obligation of this Agreement. Each party shall be responsible for any
breach of confidentiality by its Representatives, as applicable. Promptly upon Discloser’s
request at any time, Recipient shall, or in the case of Developer Data shall use reasonable
efforts to, return all of Discloser’s tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all
Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records, copies,
summaries, analyses and materials developed therefrom. Nothing herein shall prevent a party
from disclosing any of the other’s Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court
order or any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation; provided,
however, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to: (i) promptly
notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose where permitted by law, and (ii)
cooperate with Discloser in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure and/or
obtaining a protective order.</br></br>

other proprietary rights) in and to: (a) feedback, suggestions, ideas or other materials and
information provided by Beta Testers with respect to any Beta Application (“User Feedback”),
(b) the Results and (c) Developer Data. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the Results
will be presented to it in a Report, the Report Format of which is Confidential Information and

enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations and duties under this Agreement, and
that the performance of such obligations and duties does not conflict with or result in a breach of
any other agreement of Crashlytics, or any judgment, order, or decree by which such party is
bound. Developer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any and all breaches of this provision is the
remedy set forth in Section 4.4. Developer represents and warrants that it owns all right, title

LIMITING THE FOREGOING, CRASHLYTICS AND ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES,
AFFILIATES, RELATED COMPANIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
REPRESENTATIVES, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “CRASHLYTICS
ENTITIES”) MAKE NO WARRANTY: (A) THAT THE SERVICES OR RESULTS WILL MEET
YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE OR BUGFREE, (B)
REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, OR
(C) THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICES CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED. THE
CRASHLYTICS ENTITIES HEREBY DISCLAIM (FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR
SUPPLIERS) ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL
WARRANTIES ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE
OR USAGE OF TRADE.</br></br>
4.3 Claims Against Crashlytics. Developer will defend Crashlytics from all third party claims,
whether actual or alleged (collectively, “Crashlytics Claims”), and will indemnify Crashlytics
and hold Crashlytics harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses
(including reasonable attorney’s fees) resulting from such Crashlytics Claims that arise out of
Developer’s: (a) use of the Services, (b) actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of
the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights, privacy
rights or publicity rights, and (c) breach of any representations and warranties set forth in the
Agreement. Developer is solely responsible for defending any such Crashlytics Claims, subject
to Crashlytics’s right to participate with counsel of its own choosing, and for payment of all
judgments, settlements, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees, resulting from such Claims against Crashlytics, provided that Developer will not
agree to any settlement related to any such Crashlytics Claims without Crashlytics’s prior
express written consent regardless of whether or not such settlement releases Crashlytics from
any obligation or liability. If Developer uses the Services in an official capacity as an employee
or representative of a United States federal, state, or local government entity and is legally
unable to accept this indemnification provision, then it does not apply to such entity, but only to
the extent required by applicable law.</br></br>
4.4 Claims Against Developer. Crashlytics will defend the Developer from all third party claims,
actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, “Developer Claims”), and
will indemnify Developer and hold Developer harmless from any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) resulting from such
Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Services, when used as expressly
permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Crashlytics will have no obligation under this Section 4.4 or
otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (a) any use of the Services not
expressly permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Services in combination with
products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Crashlytics if such infringement
would have been avoided without the combination with such other products, equipment,
software, or data; (c) any modification of the Services by any person other than Crashlytics or its
authorized agents or subcontractors; or (d) any claim not clearly based on the Services itself.
This Section 4.4 states Crashlytics’s entire liability and Developer’s sole and exclusive remedy
for all third party claims.</br></br>
4.5 Procedure. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the party seeking indemnification:
(a) promptly notifying the other party in writing of such claim; (b) giving the other party sole
control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and,
at the other party’s request and expense, assisting in such defense. Neither party may make
any public announcement of any claim, defense or settlement without the other party’s prior
written approval. The indemnifying party may not settle, compromise or resolve a claim without
the consent of the indemnified party, if such settlement, compromise or resolution (i) causes or
requires an admission or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (i) imposes any monetary
damages against the indemnified party, or (iii) does not fully release the indemnified party from
liability with respect to the claim.</br></br>
4.6 Limitation of Liability.
(a) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES
ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR GOODWILL OR FOR
INTERRUPTION, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR NETWORKS.
(b) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL
CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIFTY ($50.00) DOLLARS (USD).

CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS OR FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE
FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO ANY
AND ALL CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY
CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT
LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. Some states do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not
apply to You. INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY
HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY
MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE LIMITATION COMPLIANT
WITH APPLICABLE LAW.</br></br>

Crashlytics Fabric services, at crashlytics.com, or otherwise through the Services. If you do not
agree to the modified terms, you shall notify Crashlytics in writing within thirty (30) days, after
which your right to access and use the Services shall immediately terminate and the Crashlytics
Entities shall have no further responsibility or liability to you. The failure of either party to enforce
its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of
such rights.</br>

(b) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals) is in any
country within APAC (other than Australia, Japan, New Zealand or Singapore) or Latin America,
this Section 6.4(b) will apply instead of Section 6.4(a) above. ALL DISPUTES (AS DEFINED
ABOVE) WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW, EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA’S
CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES.The parties will try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30
days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it must be resolved
by arbitration by the American Arbitration Association’s International Centre for Dispute
Resolution in accordance with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this
Agreement ("Rules"). The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be
conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either party may apply to any
competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the
arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies
and limitations in this Agreement. Subject to the confidentiality requirements in of this
Agreement, either party may petition any competent court to issue any order necessary to
protect that party's rights or property; this petition will not be considered a violation or waiver of
this governing law and arbitration section and will not affect the arbitrator’s powers, including the
power to review the judicial decision. The parties stipulate that the courts of Santa Clara County,
California, USA, are competent to grant any order under this subsection. The arbitral award will
be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court,
including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property. Any arbitration
proceeding conducted in accordance with this section will be considered Confidential
Information under this Agreement's confidentiality section, including: (i) the existence of, (ii) any
information disclosed during, and (iii) any oral communications or documents related to the
arbitration proceedings. The parties may also disclose the information described in this section
to a competent court as may be necessary to file any order under this section or execute any
arbitral decision, but the parties must request that those judicial proceedings be conducted in
camera (in private). The parties will pay the arbitrator’s fees, the arbitrator's appointed experts'
fees and expenses, and the arbitration center's administrative expenses in accordance with the
Rules. In its final decision, the arbitrator will determine the non-prevailing party's obligation to
reimburse the amount paid in advance by the prevailing party for these fees. Each party will
bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator’s final
decision.</br></br>
