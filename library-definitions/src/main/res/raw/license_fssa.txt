    <p>THE FABRIC TECHNOLOGY AND REPORTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, GOOGLE AND ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, RELATED COMPANIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, PARTNERS, AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “GOOGLE ENTITIES”) MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY (I) THAT THE FABRIC TECHNOLOGY AND REPORTS OR RESULTS THEREFROM WILL MEET DEVELOPER’S REQUIREMENTS OR BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR BUG-FREE, (II) REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE FABRIC TECHNOLOGY OR REPORTS, OR (III) THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE FABRIC TECHNOLOGY OR REPORTS CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED.

    <li><a href="/terms/fabric#indemnification" id="indemnification" class="terms-link">Indemnification</a>
      <ol>
        <p></p><li>Claims Against Developer. Google will defend the Developer from all third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, “Developer Claims”), and will indemnify Developer and hold Developer harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) resulting from such Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Fabric Technology, when used as expressly permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Google will have no obligation under this Section 15.1 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (a) any use of the Fabric Technology not expressly permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Fabric Technology in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Google if such infringement would have been avoided without the combination with such other products, equipment, software, or data; (c) any modification of the Fabric Technology by any person other than Google or its authorized agents or subcontractors; or (d) any claim not clearly based on the Fabric Technology itself. This Section 15.1 states Google’s entire liability and Developer’s sole and exclusive remedy for all third party claims.</li><p></p>
        <p></p><li>Claims Against Google. Developer will defend Google from all third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, “Google Claims”), and will indemnify Google and hold Google harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) resulting from such Google Claims, that arise out of Developer’s (a) use of the Fabric Technology or Reports; (b) actual or alleged infringement, misappropriation, or violation of the rights of any third party, including without limitation any intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights; and (c) breach of any term of this Agreement, including without limitation Developer’s representations and warranties set forth in Section 13 above. Developer is solely responsible for defending any such Google Claims, subject to Google’s right to participate with counsel of its own choosing, and for payment of all judgments, settlements, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from such Google Claims, provided that Developer will not agree to any settlement related to any such Google Claims without Google’s prior express written consent regardless of whether or not such settlement releases Google from any obligation or liability. If Developer uses the Fabric Technology in an official capacity as an employee or representative of a United States federal, state or local government entity and is legally unable to accept this indemnification provision, then it does not apply to such entity, but only to the extent as required by applicable law.</li><p></p>
        <p></p><li>Procedure. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the party seeking indemnification: (a) promptly notifying the other party in writing of such claim; (b) giving the other party sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and, at other party’s request and expense, assisting in such defense. Neither party may make any public announcement of any claim, defense or settlement without the other party’s prior written approval. The indemnifying party may not settle, compromise or resolve a claim without the consent of the indemnified party, if such settlement, compromise or resolution (x) causes or requires an admission or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (y) imposes any monetary damages against the indemnified party, or (z) does not fully release the indemnified party from liability with respect to the claim.</li><p></p>
      </ol>

    </li><li><a href="/terms/fabric#limitation-of-liability" id="limitation-of-liability" class="terms-link">Limitation of Liability</a></li>

    <p>(b) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIFTY($50.00) DOLLARS (USD).</p>

    <p>(c) THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS OR FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.</p>

    <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You. INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE LIMITATION COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

        <p></p><li>Amendments. Google may amend this Agreement from time to time. If Google makes a change to this Agreement that, in its sole discretion, is material, Google will notify Developer by providing notice of the change through the Services, the Plugin, or at the email address that Developer provided to Google upon signing up to access the Services. If Developer does not agree to the modified terms of the Agreement, Developer shall notify Google in writing within thirty (30) days, after which this Agreement shall immediately terminate and the Google Entities shall have no further responsibility or liability to Developer.</li><p></p>

        <p></p><li>Waivers. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights.</li><p></p>

        <p></p><li>Governing Law; Venue; Prevailing Fees. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. (a) Except as set forth in Section 18.5(b) below, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services ("Disputes”) will be governed by California law, excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, and all Disputes will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and You and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. (b) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals) is in any country within APAC (other than Australia, Japan, New Zealand or Singapore) or Latin America, this Section 18.5(b) will apply instead of Section 18.5(a) above. ALL DISPUTES (AS DEFINED ABOVE) WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW, EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA’S CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES. The parties will try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30 days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it must be resolved by arbitration by the American Arbitration Association’s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this Agreement ("Rules"). The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in this Agreement. Subject to the confidentiality requirements in this Agreement, either party may petition any competent court to issue any order necessary to protect that party's rights or property; this petition will not be considered a violation or waiver of this governing law and arbitration section and will not affect the arbitrator’s powers, including the power to review the judicial decision. The parties stipulate that the courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, are competent to grant any order under this subsection. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property. Any arbitration proceeding conducted in accordance with this section will be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement's confidentiality section, including (i) the existence of, (ii) any information disclosed during, and (iii) any oral communications or documents related to the arbitration proceedings. The parties may also disclose the information described in this section to a competent court as may be necessary to file any order under this section or execute any arbitral decision, but the parties must request that those judicial proceedings be conducted in camera (in private). The parties will pay the arbitrator’s fees, the arbitrator's appointed experts' fees and expenses, and the arbitration center's administrative expenses in accordance with the Rules. In its final decision, the arbitrator will determine the non-prevailing party's obligation to reimburse the amount paid in advance by the prevailing party for these fees. Each party will bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator’s final decision.  (c) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals) is in Greece, all Disputes (as defined above) will be governed by Greek law and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Athens in relation to any Dispute.</li><p></p>

        <p></p><li>Force Majeure. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement (except payment obligations) due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, the affected party shall give written notice thereof to the other party and its performance shall be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence.</li><p></p>

        <p></p><li>Notices.
