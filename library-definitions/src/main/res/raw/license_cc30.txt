<b>3. License Grant.</b> Subject to the terms
and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
<br /><br />
  • to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
  one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
  incorporated in the Collections;
<br /><br />
  • to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
  such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
  takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
  otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
  Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The
  original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or
  a modification could indicate \"The original work has been
  modified.\";
<br /><br />
  • to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
  as incorporated in Collections; and,
<br /><br />
  • to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
<br /><br />
  • For the avoidance of doubt:
<br />
      • <b>Non-waivable Compulsory License
      Schemes</b>. In those jurisdictions in which the
      right to collect royalties through any statutory or
      compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
      Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
      royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
      granted under this License;
<br /><br />
      • <b>Waivable Compulsory License
      Schemes</b>. In those jurisdictions in which the
      right to collect royalties through any statutory or
      compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
      Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
      royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
      granted under this License; and,
<br /><br />
      • <b>Voluntary License Schemes</b>. The
      Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
      whether individually or, in the event that the
      Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
      administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
      society, from any exercise by You of the rights
      granted under this License.
<br /><br /><br />
The above rights may be exercised in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
rights include the right to make such modifications as are
technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
<br /><br />
<b>4. Restrictions.</b> The license granted in
Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:
<br />
  • You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
  under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
  of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
  License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
  Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
  on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
  the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
  rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
  License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
  intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
  disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
  Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
  Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
  effective technological measures on the Work that
  restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
  to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
  the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
  the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
  not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
  be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
  create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
  must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
  Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
  requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
  any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
  from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
  4(b), as requested.
<br /><br />
  • If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
  any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
  request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
  intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
  reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
  the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
  applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
  and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
  a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
  attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor\'s
  copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
  means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
  of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
  practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
  be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
  refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
  for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in
  the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
  of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation
  of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on
  original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required
  by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any
  reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
  a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
  appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
  Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
  credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
  credits for the other contributing authors. For the
  avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
  by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
  manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
  this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
  or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
  by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
  Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
  without the separate, express prior written permission of
  the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
  Parties.
<br /><br />
  • Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
  or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
  You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
  either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
  Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
  take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
  which would be prejudicial to the Original Author\'s honor
  or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
  jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
  right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
  to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
  mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
  prejudicial to the Original Author\'s honor and
  reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
  appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
  permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
  to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
  this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
  otherwise.<br /><br /><br />

<b>5. Representations, Warranties and
Disclaimer</b>
<br /><br />
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
<br /><br />
<b>6. Limitation on Liability.</b> EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.
<br /><br />
<b>7. Termination</b>
<br />
  • This License and the rights granted hereunder will
  terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
  terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
  received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
  License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
  provided such individuals or entities remain in full
  compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
  and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
<br /><br />
  • Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
  license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
  the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
  the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
  Work under different license terms or to stop
  distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
  any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
  (or any other license that has been, or is required to
  be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
  License will continue in full force and effect unless
  terminated as stated above.
<br /><br /><br/>

<b>8. Miscellaneous</b>
<br />
  • Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
  or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
  license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
  the license granted to You under this License.
<br /><br />
  • Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
  Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
  the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
  license granted to You under this License.
<br /><br />
  • If any provision of this License is invalid or
  unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
  the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
  terms of this License, and without further action by the
  parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
  reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
  provision valid and enforceable.
<br /><br />
  • No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
  waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
  consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
  charged with such waiver or consent.
<br /><br />
  • This License constitutes the entire agreement between
  the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
  are no understandings, agreements or representations with
  respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
  not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
  in any communication from You. This License may not be
  modified without the mutual written agreement of the
  Licensor and You.
<br /><br />
  • The rights granted under, and the subject matter
  referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
  terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
  Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
  1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
  Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
  Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
  revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
  matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
  the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
  the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
  those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
  If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
  copyright law includes additional rights not granted
  under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
  be included in the License; this License is not intended
  to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
  law.
